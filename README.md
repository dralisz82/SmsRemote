# SmsRemote
Remote controls an Android phone by text messages.

## Introduction
SmsRemote can set, change and unset call forwarding rules on an Android phone.

It is ideal for teams having a common phone number assigned to a "front office" phone, which they don't want to always carry, but they prefer setting up call forward to phones of team members.

Team members may instruct the common phone to forward calls to their phones remotely.
As team members don't have to touch the common phone physically, SmsRemote is an ideal solution for teams working remotely and changing the on-call "front office" role frequently.
